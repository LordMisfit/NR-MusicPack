This is simply for high definition music for Naferia's Reign: Invasion of the Dark Mistress [NR-IotDM]. 

1. Make sure once you download this to put the enclosed "Music" folder into your primary NR folder. The music.def file in the NR-IotDM repo has the definition for this music, so in theory doing that should allow the high def music replacements and the DC Music pack to work.
